# MMA Fight Predictor

## Overview

MMA Fight Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the outcomes of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fights. This project uses historical fight data and fighter statistics to build a predictive model.

## Features

- Data analysis of MMA fight statistics
- Machine learning model for fight outcome prediction
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy visualization and experimentation

## Repository Structure

- `winner_predictor.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis and model development

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (specified in the notebook)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YoussefBechara/MMA-Fight-Predictor.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd MMA-Fight-Predictor


3. Install required Python libraries (it's recommended to use a virtual environment):

pip install -r requirements.txt
basic

Note: You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook winner_predictor.ipynb
livecodeserver


2. Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to run the analysis and prediction model.

## Data

The project likely uses historical MMA fight data. Due to data licensing and size constraints, the dataset may not be included in the repository. Users might need to acquire or collect their own MMA fight data to use with this predictor.

## Model

The specific machine learning model used for prediction is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook. It may include techniques such as:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks)
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and analysis

## Disclaimer

This predictor is for educational and entertainment purposes only. It should not be used as the sole basis for betting or any form of gambling. Always gamble responsibly and within your means.
